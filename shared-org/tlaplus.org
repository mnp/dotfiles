Simplifying by removing details is called abstraction

We use TLA+ to ensure the systems we build “work right”.
Working right means satisfying certain properties.

definitions
- execution of a system is a sequence of discrete steps
- step is a change from one state to another
- state is an assignment of values to a set of variables
- a sequence of states is a behavior

we want to SPECIFY all possible BEHAVIORs of a system

to specify a state machine need: 
 - The variables, including a PC,
 - their initial values,
 - and the relation between their values in the current state and their possible values in the next state.

state machines eliminate low level program details
