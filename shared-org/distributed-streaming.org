Evaluating Message Brokers: Kafka vs. Kinesis vs. SQS 

* Why
- queueing smooths out spikes in ingest rate

* SQS
- destroys message once consumed
- out of order delivery
- consumer can filter what it wants https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/filter-messages-published-to-topics/

* Kafka
- distributed message log that provides a publish-subscribe messaging model
- multiple producers, multiple consumers; ie, messages can be consumed multiple times
- ordering guarantee
- most complex but most possibilies

* Kinesis
Someone doesn't like it as a cost concern, saying sns+sqs instead. They were debated on HN.

* conclusions?
- Kinesis better for Eventing
- Kafka better for downstream data ingestion and processing

* questions
how is [[file:tlaplus.org][TLA+]] be useful to verify?
